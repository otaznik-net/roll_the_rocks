# Hidden message

A friend send you a weird package containing only a piece of jewellery
or something like that. Black and white cubes on a string.
After failing with things like Morse code, you left it on a table and started
to think what else you can try.
After while you looked at it again and as you unconsciously started to
rotate the very first cube, the other were rolled on
and something like picture appeared ...

## Sounds like fun?

Take the string from file available in this repo (https://github.com/otaznik-net/roll_the_rocks/)
and start rolling it around (clockwise) character by character to discover hidden message

e.g.
```
"123456789" =>

923
814
765

"523   641" =>

123
45
6
```
