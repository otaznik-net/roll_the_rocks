# Hidden message

A friend send you a weird package containing only a piece of jewellery
or something like that. Black and white cubes on a string.
After failing with things like Morse code, you left it on a table and started
to think what else you can try.
After while you looked at it again and as you unconsciously started to
rotate the very first cube, the other were rolled on
and something like picture appeared ...

## Sounds like fun?

Take the string from file available in this repo (https://github.com/otaznik-net/roll_the_rocks/)
and start rolling it around (clockwise) character by character to discover hidden message

e.g.
```
"123456789" =>

923
814
765

"523   641" =>

123
45 
6  

"a45b gf93    6c      e82                    d71" =>

        
        
123456  
789abc  
defg    
        
        

```

## Solutions

Feel free to post PRs with your own solution to this (PR will be merged if it does what it should ...
and does not do something I do not wish in my repo)

There was a submission from a friend who decided to not publish it ='(
What I really liked (and hated) on that solution was it was sent as a picture
of 18x18 chars (solution code fed to itself) which looked just awesome.

But please, send your code in plaintext =D
